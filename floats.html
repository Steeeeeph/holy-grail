      <p>Started this interesting journey at BeCode, learning along with my team members in the Verou class under the wings
      of coach Bert Heyman. Currently we're in the first stage of this journey: the Field.</p>
      <p>In the Field we're learning mainly front-end languages like HTML, CSS, Markdown along with terminal coding to be able 
      to create a platform on GitHub to be able to build our own project communities. It's a lot to take in but I'm trusting
      enough nobody in our group would let another drown in this matter. We're in this together an the atmosphere is very
      motivational and positive. <strong>We're in this together!</strong>
